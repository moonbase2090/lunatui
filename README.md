# lunatui

lunatui is a hyperspeed Rust TUI library being built from scratch, keeping a simple "render widgets into a rectangle" model while fixing its structural costs with a 16-byte packed cell, damage-tracked diffing and a single-write output encoder, plus first-class input, focus, animation, capability and theme layers. It is open source under the [MIT](LICENSE) license.

**Status: v0.1.8 preview** — first usable release on the roadmap (Phase 4 widgets, encoder, runtime, tests). APIs and backends still evolve before 1.0. Start with [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md), the [architecture overview](docs/architecture.md), and the [PRD](docs/PRD.md).

## Performance

Lunatui's own dashboard numbers on one machine (Apple M5 Max, release build), median of five runs of 240 frames at 80×24:

| Size | Median frame | p95 | Allocations per frame | Bytes written per frame |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80×24 | 60 µs | 65 µs | ≈39 | 603 |
| 200×60 | 249 µs | 285 µs | ≈69 | 2868 |

Method and limits: [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/moonbase2090/lunatui
cd lunatui
cargo run --example live_dashboard
```

The dashboard draws 240 frames (about four seconds) and exits. Add `-- --bench` for a headless timing run. More examples are listed in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).

### Calendar

A team schedule: the month beside that day's agenda, colored release, review, on-call, and incident days, today held in a raised cell, and the selection walking from late October into November.
